The class "vVolume" is implemented to resemble a volume that can be attached to a container in Docker or Kubernetes which consumes the ROM from "vHost". A "vContainer" could be attached with multiple "vVolume" and those  "vVolume" could be allocated on different "vHost" rather than the "vHost" where the "vContainer" is hosted. A "vVolume" could be persistent by setting attribute "retain" equals to true. If a "vVolume" is persistent, it will not be destoried when its associated "vContainer" is terminated and could be reattached to a new instance of the "vContainer". The "vVolume" must be allocated first before a "vContainer" is scheduled. If any "vVolume" is failed to be allocated onto "vHost", the schedule of its associated "vContainer" will be on hold.
